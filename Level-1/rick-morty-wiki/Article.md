Before starting the project, follow these steps to setup our project -

- Create a folder named 'react-wiki'
- open folder in VS code
- open terminal and run these commands one by one ðŸ‘‡

```JS
npx create-react-app .

npm install bootstrap

npm install @popperjs/core --save

npm install sass

npm install react-paginate --save

npm start
```

To make our dev experience easier, download these VS code extensions

# Folder structure

We are dividing our entire project into 4 components. They're -

- Cards
- Pagination
- Search
- Filter

Create a folder named 'components' inside your 'src' folder and make 4 folders like this ðŸ‘‡

Then, for each folder, create a JavaScript and Modular SCSS file. Something like this ðŸ‘‡

### App.js

Some other changes you need to do -

- import React hooks and bootstrap at the top in App.js

  ```JS
  import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  ```

- import all our modules from components

  ```JS
  import Search from "./components/Search/Search";
  import Card from "./components/Card/Card";
  import Pagination from "./components/Pagination/Pagination";
  import Filter from "./components/Filter/Filter";
  ```

- inside the resturn statement, remove everything and place these ðŸ‘‡

  ```HTML
  <div className="App">
      <header className="fs-1 fw-bold text-capitalize text-center my-4 ubuntu">
        Rick & Morty <span className="text-primary">WiKi</span>
      </header>
  </div>
  ```
